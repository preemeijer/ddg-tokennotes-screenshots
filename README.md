# ddg-tokennotes-screenshots

This repository contains the added screenshots per domain that are active on the community platform (duck.co) translation system.


The way that I work at the moment (so I don't forget)
-----------
 * A document with all the tokens that have screenshots.
 * Split tokens up with a filter on the community platform with the maximum of 100 tokens per page. (This gives a total of 10 pages.)
 
 * All the tokens that have screenshots added to the document to have an overview of links and which tokenscreenshot already have been added.
